Equanimity will adjudicate the Rental fee on your behalf, which means processing the Renters credit card, retaining a commission as set forth in our Fee and Commission Schedule, and remitting such funds to you as provided in this section. Shelflet will remit payments due to you hereunder no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month in which the applicable fees are received. Payment shall be in the form you select when you register for the Service, or subsequently updated as permitted by the Service. Payments shall only be made in those months in which the amount due to you totals at least $50.00. Unpaid amounts due shall accrue until the next month in which the amount due is at least $50.00. Shelflet reserves the right to withhold payment or charge back to your account any amounts otherwise due to us under this Agreement, or any amounts due as a result of a breach of this Agreement by you, pending Shelflet 's reasonable investigation of such breach. To ensure proper payment, you are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with your account, which includes without limitation applicable tax information. If we believe that we are obligated to obtain tax information and you do not provide this information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold your payments until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us that you are not a person or entity from whom we are required to obtain tax information. Any bank fees related to returned or cancelled checks due to a contact or payment information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment. You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your participation in the Service. If you dispute any payment made hereunder, you must notify Shelflet in writing within thirty (30) days of any such payment; failure to so notify Shelflet shall result in the waiver by you of any claim relating to any such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by Shelflet. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by Shelflet or have any effect under this Agreement.
