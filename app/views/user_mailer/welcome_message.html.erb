    Welcome <%= @user.first_name %>! <br><br>

    Shelflet makes it easy to list and rent out your books to friends, peers and anyone else.<br><br>

    To get started, <a href="http://0.0.0.0:3000/list">list your books</a> so people can rent them from you starting January (our beta launch!).<br> <br>

    Weâ€™re really excited to have you join our market community!
